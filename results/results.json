Entry 232800 corresponds to Glycogen Storage Disease VII (GSD7), which is known to be due to phosphofructokinase deficiency. The other two entries are for PFKL (Phosphofructokinase, Liver Type) and AK1 (Adenylate Kinase 1). However, the classic form affects muscle (PFKM), but the summary most relevant to hemolytic anemia and GSD7 involves the PFKM gene. Here, the OMIM summaries directly mention PFKL but not PFKM, perhaps due to alternate disease naming. Based on the OMIM summaries\u2014especially the titles\u2014I will report PFKL (from 171860) as the gene of interest.",
