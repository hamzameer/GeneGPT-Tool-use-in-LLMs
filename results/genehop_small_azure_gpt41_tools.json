(2) Focusing on the PFKL gene, which is implicated in GSD7, I looked up its gene entry in the NCBI gene database and found multiple matches. (3) Among these, only gene 141468746 is named PFKL but is from a non-human organism, while the true human PFKL gene is not directly found in this batch. Based on typical results and OMIM linkage, GSD7 is associated with the PFKM gene (muscle-type phosphofructokinase; not returned here), but PFKL also appears via OMIM. Since the NCBI gene summary for the PFKL gene (in this batch, 141468746) is from Eurasian curlew and lacks a map location, no direct human chromosome location is retrieved, but prior knowledge is 21q22.3 for PFKM (which should be verified in a further step if PFKM is found).",
