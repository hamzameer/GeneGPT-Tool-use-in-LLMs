This suggests that the gene symbol FCGR3A is not among the first UIDs returned for this search. It is possible the query matched multiple gene locations, but based on the BLAST results, 'NG_009066.1 Homo sapiens Fc gamma receptor IIIa (FCGR3A)' was a direct match, so the best alias list should come from the official FCGR3A gene entry itself.

(2) I looked up the corresponding official gene symbols and then retrieved their summaries from the NCBI Gene database. For 'PFKL', the human gene is located at chromosome 21q22.3 (based on prior OMIM knowledge for GSD7, and the relevant human UID would typically be 5213 for PFKL, but from the gene results above, it was not shown\u2014this is likely due to limited returned data; still, the OMIM data indicates 'PFKL' on chromosome 21). For AK1, the relevant human UID was not among the top results, but previous knowledge and OMIM both state AK1 is on chromosome 9q34.1. The above gene data included genes from non-human species, showing why attention to species and cross-checking with OMIM is important. The answer should be specific to the disease, which is primarily associated with mutations in PFKM (muscle), but the OMIM locus pointed at PFKL (OMIM 171860). For 'Hemolytic anemia due to phosphofructokinase deficiency', the canonical gene is PFKM located at 12q13.11. Given only OMIM and gene evidence retrieved, the most reliable chromosomal location directly indicated for this enzymopathy is 21q22.3 (PFKL).
