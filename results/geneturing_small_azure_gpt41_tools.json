The OMIM summaries pointed to phosphofructokinase isozymes. 2. I examined genes corresponding to known relevant entries, especially those named PFKL (liver), PFKM (muscle), and other isozymes. 3. Looking at the gene summaries, PFKM and PFKL are the major human genes encoding subunits for phosphofructokinase, mutations in which cause glycolytic pathway defects leading to the disease. The main gene known to cause classic Glycogen Storage Disease type VII (Tarui Disease), which is hemolytic anemia due to phosphofructokinase deficiency, is PFKM (muscle type). PFKL may also be referenced, but PFKM is primarily causative.",
